# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System

A machine learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts the most suitable crop based on input parameters.
- Clean and user-friendly web interface.
- Uses a trained machine learning model for predictions.
- Real-time weather integration using an API.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python** (Backend & Model)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** (Data preprocessing & ML)
- **Flask** (Backend server)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend)
- **Google Colab** (Model training & analysis)
- **Optional**: Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- **Features**:
  - N - Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
  - P - Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
  - K - Ratio of Potassium content in soil
  - Temperature - in Celsius
  - Humidity - in %
  - pH - value of soil
  - Rainfall - in mm

## ðŸ”® Model

- Algorithm: `Random Forest Classifier`
- Accuracy: 95% 
- Trained on the provided dataset with preprocessing and feature scaling.
